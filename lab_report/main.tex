\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present the results of two experiments in quantum optics. The first is a repetition of the one originally performed by \textcite[]{grangierExperimentalEvidencePhoton1986}, which shows that light is made up of indivisible quanta. The second one provides and tests a convenient low-tech way to turn a coherent LASER state into a thermal state.
